**Behavior:** Joins to server with the same name as a player. Right at join tries to send a kick vote. During gameplay using: <ul><li>Aimbot</li><li>Lagger</li><li>Spy-reveal</li><li>(optional) [Noise Maker - TF Birthday](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Noise_Maker#Team_Fortress_Birthday)</li><li>Same loadout as player (except sniper rifle)</li></ul>

**Status:**<span style="color:gold">**Solvable**</span>

**Posible solution:** With new TF2 update you can detect the right player, and bot can't call kick vote immediately.<br/> You need to work like a team and kick bot in 1.5 seconds after kick vote appear to confuse bot completly.

**Posible problems:** Bot can send `retry`-command on the end of kick-vote. This can be done 4 times for every bot on the server.
